# goUFV App - Ideation Jam Project

The **goUFV** app was conceived during a two-day hackathon as part of the Ideation Jam Project. Our goal was to come up with an innovative and user-friendly app idea for the University of the Fraser Valley (UFV). The app aims to integrate essential features to improve campus life, communication, and academic management for students and faculty members. 

The app was designed to consolidate various UFV-related tasks into one seamless platform, improving accessibility and convenience for the university community.

## Features of goUFV App

- **Interactive Campus Map**:  
  A dynamic and easy-to-use map that helps students and visitors navigate the UFV campus. It includes building locations, room numbers, and facilities like cafeterias and libraries.

- **Simplified Communication Between Professors and Students**:  
  A feature that allows direct messaging and notifications between professors and students, improving engagement and reducing communication barriers.

- **Grade Tracking**:  
  Students can track their grades in real-time, view assignments, and monitor their progress throughout the semester. Professors can also update grades quickly and efficiently.

- **Clubs and Events Integration**:  
  Students can explore and join clubs, organizations, and university events. The app integrates event calendars, meeting times, and club activities in one place, promoting student involvement on campus.

- **University Announcements**:  
  Stay up-to-date with the latest UFV news, announcements, and emergency alerts, ensuring students and faculty never miss important updates.

- **Timetable Management**:  
  A feature to manage class schedules, set reminders for lectures, assignments, and exams, and sync with personal calendars.

## Steps to Develop the goUFV App

1. **Brainstorming**:  
   During the hackathon, we collaborated to identify the common pain points and challenges faced by UFV students and faculty. We conducted quick research to see what existing solutions were available and how we could integrate multiple aspects into one app.

2. **Wireframing and Design**:  
   The app design was created using wireframing tools like Figma, focusing on a user-friendly interface with easy navigation and an attractive layout for students and faculty.

3. **Defining Key Features**:  
   We brainstormed features that would benefit both students and professors, such as the campus map, grade tracking, and communication tools. We refined each feature to ensure maximum impact on campus life.

4. **Development Planning**:  
   We mapped out the app’s architecture, keeping scalability in mind. We discussed using frameworks such as Flutter or React Native for cross-platform app development to ensure wide accessibility on both Android and iOS devices.

5. **Pitching the Idea**:  
   At the end of the hackathon, we presented our app idea to a panel of judges, explaining the problem it solves, the target audience, and its potential impact on the UFV community.

## Outcomes

- **High Potential for Adoption**:  
  The app received positive feedback for its practicality and wide range of features. It’s seen as a valuable tool for improving student engagement, communication, and academic management.

- **Collaboration and Teamwork**:  
  This project was a great example of teamwork, with each participant contributing their unique skills in design, development, and ideation. The hackathon environment encouraged creative problem-solving and rapid prototyping.

## Conclusion

The **goUFV** app provides a vision for a unified mobile experience at the University of the Fraser Valley. It would help streamline campus life, improve communication, and enhance the overall student experience.
